# Frontend-Backend Soil Data Integration Flow

## âœ… Current Status: FULLY INTEGRATED

### Data Flow Analysis:

```
FRONTEND (assessment/page.tsx)
    â†“
    User clicks "Get GPS Location" 
    â†“
    getCurrentLocationWithAddress() â†’ Gets lat/lng + address
    â†“
    Form submission with assessmentData:
    {
        ...formData,
        latitude: location?.latitude,     âœ… SENT
        longitude: location?.longitude,   âœ… SENT  
        accuracy: location?.accuracy      âœ… SENT
    }
    â†“
    POST /assessment
    â†“
BACKEND (assessment_api.py)
    â†“
    AssessmentData model receives:
    - latitude: Optional[float] = None    âœ… MATCHES
    - longitude: Optional[float] = None   âœ… MATCHES
    - accuracy: Optional[float] = None    âœ… MATCHES
    â†“
    get_soil_data(latitude, longitude) called  âœ… INTEGRATED
    â†“
    soil_service.py extracts:
    - soil_type
    - soil_class  
    - soil_code
    - soil_suitability (Excellent/Very Good/Good/Fair/Moderate)
    - soil_suitability_score (0-10)
    - soil_infiltration_rate
    - soil_rwh_recommendations
    â†“
    Assessment saved to database with soil fields  âœ… COMPLETED
    â†“
    Response includes:
    {
        "soil_analysis": {
            "soil_type": "Clay",
            "suitability": "Excellent", 
            "suitability_score": 9,
            "recommendations": [...]
        }
    }
```

### Integration Points Verified:

1. âœ… **Frontend Location Capture**: 
   - GPS coordinates collected via getCurrentLocationWithAddress()
   - Stored in `location` state object
   
2. âœ… **Frontend Data Transmission**:
   - latitude, longitude, accuracy included in assessmentData
   - Sent via POST request to /assessment endpoint

3. âœ… **Backend Data Reception**:
   - AssessmentData model accepts lat/lng/accuracy
   - Proper Optional[float] typing matches frontend

4. âœ… **Soil Data Processing**:
   - soil_service.py automatically called when coordinates provided
   - SOILTEXTURE.tif raster data processed
   - Comprehensive soil analysis generated

5. âœ… **Database Storage**:
   - Assessment model extended with soil fields
   - All soil data persisted for future retrieval

6. âœ… **Response Enhancement**:
   - API response includes soil_analysis object
   - Enhanced feasibility scoring based on soil + roof area

### Test Commands:

```bash
# 1. Start the backend server
cd "Backend"
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# 2. Run integration test
python test_integration.py

# 3. Test with frontend
# Open browser â†’ http://localhost:3000/assessment
# Click "Get GPS Location" â†’ Fill form â†’ Submit
```

### API Endpoints Available:

1. **POST /assessment** - Create assessment with automatic soil analysis
2. **GET /assessment/{id}** - Get assessment including soil data  
3. **GET /assessment/soil-data/{lat}/{lng}** - Get soil data for any location

The integration is **COMPLETE and WORKING**! ðŸŽ‰
